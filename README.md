# Music Analytics — SQL Portfolio Project

A collection of 9 advanced SQL queries exploring genre patterns, artist dominance, and relational data modeling using the Chinook music dataset.

## Author Profile
I study mathematics as a language to decode human systems — from behavioral patterns to digital ecosystems. My work sits at the intersection of data modeling, cognition-inspired analytics, and clean information design. I treat SQL not just as a querying tool, but as a disciplined way of thinking — closer to proof strategy than code.


## Queries Included
1. Top 10 Artists by Rock Genre Songs  
2. Album Count per Artist  
3. Revenue Distribution Per Genre  
4. Customer Lifetime Value Ranking  
5. Tracks With Above-Average Playtime  
6. Genre-Wise Track Density  
7. Artist Consistency Score (Tracks/Album Ratio)  
8. Revenue-Per-Track Efficiency  
9. Cross-Genre Artist Presence

Each query is written with intention: readable structure, academic clarity, and performance-aware JOIN logic — mirroring standards expected in research groups and high-level data fellowships.

## SQL Stack
- PostgreSQL syntax
- PRAGMA for readability & explain plans encouraged
- Written with analytical granularity suited for lab review or academic demonstration
